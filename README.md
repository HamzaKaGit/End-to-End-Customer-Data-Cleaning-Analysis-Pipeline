# End-to-End-Customer-Data-Cleaning-Analysis-Pipeline

Engineered a complete data ingestion and transformation pipeline using Python (standard libraries only), converting flat CSV records into nested JSON structures for 1000+ customer entries.

Designed logic to detect and repair data anomalies (e.g., blank values, malformed credit card durations), ensuring robust data validation and cleanup.

Segmented users by employment/retirement status and computed business metrics like Salary-per-Commute-KM, generating actionable insights for ranking and analysis.

Developed a suite of insightful univariate and multivariate visualizations using Pandas and Seaborn to uncover trends across age, salary, commute, and dependents.
